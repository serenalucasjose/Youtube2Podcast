# Translation Pipeline Dependencies
# Optimized for CPU-only environments (Raspberry Pi 4 / ARM64)
# Compatible with Python 3.10-3.12

# STT - Speech to Text (faster-whisper uses CTranslate2, much faster than OpenAI whisper)
faster-whisper>=1.0.0

# Translation - Helsinki-NLP models via Hugging Face
transformers>=4.36.0
sentencepiece>=0.1.99

# TTS - Text to Speech 
# Using pyttsx3 as fallback for Python 3.12 compatibility
# For better quality, use gTTS (Google TTS) or edge-tts (Microsoft Edge TTS)
edge-tts>=6.1.0
pydub>=0.25.1

# Audio processing
scipy>=1.11.0
numpy>=1.24.0

# PDF generation for transcriptions
fpdf2>=2.7.0

# Torch CPU-only (required by faster-whisper and transformers)
--extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
torch>=2.0.0

# LLM - Local Language Model for script generation
# Using transformers with a small model (no llama-cpp compilation needed)
